# Project-64
2.00 MW Kalm Small Hydro Power project by Sunshine Hydro Power Limited, Himachal Pradesh, India

Applied Baseline Methodology:
AMS-I.D : “Grid connected renewable electricity
generation”, version 18
Standardized Methodology: Not Applicable

The proposed project activity is promoted by Sunshine Hydro Power Limited (herein after called as project proponent ‘PP’). The proposed project activity is installation and operation of 2 Pelton Hydro Turbine Generators having individual capacity 1000 kW with aggregated installed capacity of 2.00 MW in District - Chamba, Himachal Pradesh state of India. This project activity is also called as Kalm small hydroelectric power (SHEP) project, Generating Renewable energy.

The proposed project activity is installation and operation of 2 Pelton Hydro Turbine
Generators having individual capacity1000kW with aggregated installed capacity of 2.00MW in District
-Chamba, Himachal Pradesh state of India. This project activity is also called as Kalm small hydroelectric
power (SHEP) project.

Kalm SHEP project isa run-of-river project located in Chamba District in the state of Himachal Pradesh.
It utilizes flow of Kalm nallah perennial tributary of Beas River which in turn is a tributary of Ravi River
for generation of hydro power. The project envisages a generation capacity of 2.00MW of power by
utilizing the available head of nalla hat elevations El 2800m above mean sea level. The project activity
aims to harness kinetic energy of water (renewable source) to generate electricity. The project comprises
a Trench weir which diverts the water into an intake placed on the left bank of Kalm nallah. The diverted
water passes through Desilting basin. Desilted water enters into water conductor system, forebay and the
steel pressure shaft. A surface powerhouse is suitably located on a terrace at left bank of the nallah. Tail
water from the powerhouse is discharged back into the nallah. The project utilises a net head of about
337m. 

The project activity involves 2 numbers hydro turbine generators of Pelton Horizontal type (1000 KW
each) with internal electrical lines connecting the project activity with local evacuation facility i.e., a substation at Lahru. The generators generate power at 3.3kV, which can further be stepped up to 33 KV. The
project activity can operate in the frequency of 50 Hz (± 3%) and in the voltage range of 3.3kV ± 10%.
The average life time of the generator is around 35 years as per the equipment supplier specification.

The project activity has been commissioned for commercial operation as on 17/10/2014.
